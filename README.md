# Web Development Project 4 - *Name of App Here*

Submitted by: **Sean Craig**

This web app: **This is site uses the CatAPI to get random cats, and ideally provides functionality allowing for you to ban and unban cats of categories from appearing with visual elements to match.**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [✓] **Clicking a button creates a new API fetch request and displays at least three attributes from the returned JSON data**
- [✓] **Only one item/API call is viewable at a time**
- [✓] **API calls appear random to the user**
- [✓] **At least one image is displayed per API call**
- [✓] **Clicking on a displayed value for one attribute adds it to a displayed ban list**
- [x] **Attributes on the ban list prevent further images/API results with that attribute from being displayed**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [✓] Multiple types of attributes can be added to the ban list
- [x] Users can see a stored history of their previously viewed items from their session

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the site's functionality!

## Notes

This was more complex to implement than I had expected. Since I've never used APIs before, the guides that CatAPI did have could only get me so far. The biggest challenges were to get the bans and unbans to work, as well as get the image to scale down, and also to get the buttons to appear when I needed them to match the bans and unbans. I didn't have as much time left over to work on this project this week, so there was a good amount left undone, unfortunately.
